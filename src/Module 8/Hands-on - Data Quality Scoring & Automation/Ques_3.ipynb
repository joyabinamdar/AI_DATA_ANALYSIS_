    "1. Objective: Set up Great Expectations and create initial expectations for a dataset.\n",
    "2. Steps:\n",
    "    - Install Great Expectations using pip.\n",
    "    - Initialize a data context.\n",
    "    - Create basic expectations on a sample dataset.\n",
    "    - Eg., Implement a basic setup and expectation for column presence and type."
